# TravelAgency - C++ Semester Project

This repository contains the source code for a C++ semester project focused on object-oriented programming principles and GUI development. The project demonstrates the application of various C++ concepts and utilizes the Qt framework to create a user-friendly interface.

## Learning Objectives:
- Gain a comprehensive understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Develop proficiency in C++ programming, including classes, objects, methods, constructors, destructors, pointers, references, and memory management.
- Design and implement small to medium-scale programs using object-oriented principles.
- Master the fundamentals of class structures as building blocks for applications.
- Comprehend the role of inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding, and generic structures in creating reusable code.
- Effectively utilize pre-written classes and modules for system development.

## Key Technologies:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
- **C++ Programming Language**: Classes, objects, methods, constructors, destructors, pointers, references, memory management
- **Qt Framework**: GUI development, widgets, signals and slots, layouts

This project serves as a practical application of theoretical knowledge gained in the C++ semester course. Feel free to explore the codebase and learn from the implementation of OOP concepts and the Qt framework.
